Mira
====

Mira is a minimal Viddler client. I named it Mira because I had just created another gem with a Spanish name (buscando_el_viento) and I figured I might as well keep the momentum going. "Mira" in Spanish means "look."

I created Mira because the official Viddler gem `viddler-ruby` didn't work out of the box, and fixing whatever was wrong with it seemed like a lot more work than just writing my own.

Mira supports only a tiny subset of the Viddler API's functionality - namely the ability to upload a video, and the ability to obtain an existing video's Flash video player embed code.

embed code copied from the original `viddler` gem (which was not actually written by Viddler); upload functionality and specs adapted from Viddler's official `viddler-ruby` gem.
